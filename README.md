# Strongsteam documentation sources
This folder contains the Strongsteam documentation files, powered by Sphinx.
A service hook links this repo to ReadTheDocs, which rebuilds the docs at each new commit.

The official built docs can be seen at http://readthedocs.org/docs/strongsteam/en/latest/

The theme has been manually customized and packaged as a standard Sphinx theme, and can be re-used for any project.
